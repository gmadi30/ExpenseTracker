Expense Tracker APP
-
I had doubts about what "CLI" means for this app. Instead of running "java App [commands]" every time, I've decided to do it without the commands and let the user input them inside the program. 

Steps to run it after cloning it: 
1. Go to the project folder from the terminal and compile the main class "javac Main.java"
2. Run "java Main" (without the extension) and the program should start
3. A menu will start with the commands to apply
4. After typing exit, the program will end, and if expenses are added, a file will be created with all the expenses.
   The file will be created in the src folder.

I am more than welcome to feedback and suggestions. 

Much love, 
Georges.
